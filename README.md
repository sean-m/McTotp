This is NIH and you should probably not use this. It's intended to be a good OATH TOTP token generator application that supports features such as: getting QR codes from the current screen and backing up the settings to disk for use later (secured with semetric encryption). It also needs to be open source and cross platform, I do use every major operating system on a regular basis. We'll see how much actually gets done.
